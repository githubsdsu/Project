                <p>
                    Aloe vera has numerous healing properties. An older 2009 studyTrusted Source suggested that taking a daily aloe vera gel supplement significantly reduced the appearance of wrinkles in just 90 days.
In a 2015 studyTrusted Source, scientists found that applying aloe gel to the skin significantly reduced the appearance of wrinkles and also added collagen and hydration.

              <p>
                Bananas contain natural oils and vitamins that can boost skin health.

Experts recommend applying banana paste to the skin:

    Mash a quarter of a banana until it becomes a smooth paste.
    Put a thin layer of the banana paste on your skin.
    Allow it to sit for 15 to 20 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water.

              <p>
                While egg whites might contribute to a small improvement in the skinâ€™s appearance, the thin membrane that separates the white from the shell is more effective.
In a 2016 studyTrusted Source, using a cream made with egg membrane led to a significant reduction in wrinkle depth and increased production of collagen, which makes skin smoother and stretchy.
However, people who are allergic to eggs should avoid using them to treat their wrinkles.

              <b>Massage</b>
              <p>
                Many people turn to massage to prevent and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. In fact, the use of a handheld facial massage device may help prevent wrinkles by increasing proteins that keep the skin smooth.
A daily facial massage for 3 to 5 minutes done with your fingers can give the same effects on the skin. It can also reduce stress, a common cause of wrinkles.
Many spas and massage salons offer facial massage treatments. At home, you can give yourself a facial massage by applying firm pressure with your fingers to either side of your face and moving them in circular strokes.
